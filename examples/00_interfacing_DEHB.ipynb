    "DEHB was designed to be an algorithm for Hyper Parameter Optimization (HPO). DEHB uses Differential Evolution (DE) under-the-hood as an Evolutionary Algorithm to power the black-box optimization that HPO problems pose. DE is a black-box optimization algorithm that generates candidate configurations $x$, to the black-box function $f(x)$, that is being optimized. The $x$ is evaluated by the black-box and the corresponding response $y$ is made available to the DE algorithm, which can then use this observation ($x$, $y$), along with previous such observations, to suggest a new candidate $x$ for the next evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "DEHB also uses Hyperband along with DE, to allow for cheaper approximations of the actual evaluations of $x$. Let $f(x)$ be the validation error of training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) on the complete training set. Multi-fidelity algorithms such as Hyperband, allow for cheaper approximations along a possible *fidelity*. For the MLP, a subset of the dataset maybe a cheaper approximation to the full data set evaluation. Whereas the fidelity can be quantified as the fraction of the dataset used to evaluate the configuration $x$, instead of the full dataset. Such approximations can allow sneak-peek into the black-box, potentially revealing certain landscape features of *f(x)*, thus rendering it a *gray*-box and not completely opaque and black! \n",

    "The $z$ parameter is the fidelity parameter to the black-box function. If $z \\in [fidelity_{min}, fidelity_{max}]$, then $f(x, fidelity_{max})$ would be equivalent to the black-box case of $f(x)$.\n",

    "* the *target_function* (`f`) that is the primary black-box function to optimize\n",
    "* the fidelity range of `min_fidelity` and `max_fidelity` that allows the cheaper, faster gray-box optimization of `f`\n",
    "* the search space or the input domain of the function `f`, that can be represented as a `ConfigSpace` object and passed to DEHB at initialization\n",

    "\n",
    "Following which, DEHB can be run for any amount of practical real-world budget. It can be run for either:\n",
    "* a total amount of actual wallclock time, example one day (~86400 seconds), or\n",
    "* a total number of function evaluations, or the number of times we want the black-box to be accessed for evaluation, across all fidelities\n",
    "* the total number of *brackets* we want to run the DEHB algorithm for\n",
