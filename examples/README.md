Examples

We provide several examples of how to use DEHB with Python. The examples were structured in order to give the user an
introduction to the interface of DEHB and how to use it. Moreover the examples show how to use DEHB with and without
the ConfigSpace library and an exemplary optimization with PyTorch.
